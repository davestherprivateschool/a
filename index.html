                <p>Davesther Private School was registered as a Nusery and Primary School by the Corporate 
                    Affairs Commission on August 11th, 2021.
                </p>
                <p>The name of the school was given clearance for use by
                    the Lagos State Ministry Of Education on September 25th, 2017 and in the same month,
                    it started operation by admitting its first pupils.</p>
                <p>On October 9th, 2018, the school received its Tax Identification Number (TIN) from the
                    Federal Inland Revenue Services as a responsible corparate citizen</p>
                <p>
                    Davesther Primary School is located in the serene environment of Green Field Estate, Okota; 
                    reputed for well-paved roads and tight internal security.

                <div class="none">
                    <p>The Christian-oriented school has a crop of qualified, experienced and dedicated teachers, most of whom are 
                    university graduates, that have keyed into the school's vision of training God-fearing and
                    excellence-minded future leaders of Nigeria.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The school building was purposely built  to enhance learning through standard and well-ventilated classrooms,
                    modern gadgets, a well-equipped computer room, standard library and healing bay. 
                    </p>
                    <p>We also have two play grounds that are equipped with prescribed facilities, including a mini football field.

                  school fees. In line with our mission statement, all text books (including French) and learning methods used in the school are those approved by the Lagos State Ministry Of Education. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  The school engages in a number of extra-curricular activities designed to sharpen the intellectual, musical and sports
                  skills of the pupils.
                </p>
                <p>
